# mnist-idx-conduit

Conduit decoders for MNIST IDX data files, as described in http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ . 

The IDX format is a low-level binary representation for storing general vector, image or tensor data. 

Here the parsers are specialized to the MNIST dataset, which stores scans of handwritten digits and is a classic benchmark for text classification.
